# Inventory Summary Tool

This tool reads product data from a CSV file, calculates the total inventory value,
and highlights low-stock items (e.g., quantity < 5).

## How to Run

1. Make sure `inventory.csv` is in the same folder as the script.
2. Run the program:

```bash
python3 inventory_summary_tool.py
